## Received feedback for this presentation:
1.  Thank you it was very insightful and productive.
One stop shop for all the research and publication workflow.

2.  Just want to thank you for the presentation this morning. It’s very helpful.

3.  Hi Usman – thanks for the Quarto workshop – while I have been working with Markdown for two of my courses, I wasn’t aware of the Quarto option – and Quarto will make a huge difference for me and my students as it makes the learning curve so much easier! So I will incorporate it in both [------] and [-----] [courses]! I also like the blogging/Git option – I made already a personal website on [-----] but never posted it – but github makes lots of sense so I will probably move everything there!
 
Ps. If you have time to attend the [-----] meeting next week, it would be great if you could give a 5 minute talk on Quarto, focusing on the visual option of Quarto which makes doing things in Markdown so much easier – I know several of my colleagues are using R but I doubt many are aware of Quarto.
